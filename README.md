# Thank Goodness It's Tetris (TGIT) üïπÔ∏è

*A classic case of "I should be doing something productive, but let's build Tetris in Rust instead."*

This project is the result of a "Friday Fun" commit, where the allure of stacking brightly colored blocks was far greater than the allure of... well, anything else.

## What is this glorious time-waster?

This is a classic-style Tetris clone built from scratch using Rust and the wonderfully simple **macroquad** game library. It has all the features you'd expect for a solid procrastination session, all wrapped up in a retro, green-on-black terminal aesthetic.

It's simple, it's fun, and it probably has a few bugs that I'll call "unintended features."

## Features (a.k.a. "The Buttons Do Things")

* **Classic Tetris Gameplay:** The stuff you know and love. Blocks fall, you make lines, they disappear. Magic!
* **Ghost Piece:** See where your block will land before you commit to your life choices.
* **Hold Piece:** Save that precious I-block for the perfect moment of glory.
* **Hard Drop & Soft Drop:** For both the patient strategist and the "I have no time for this" player.
* **Scoring System:** Watch the numbers go up as your responsibilities fade away.
* **Increasing Difficulty:** The game gets faster, just like my heart rate when the blocks get too high.

## Building from Source (If You're Feeling Brave)

Want to run this masterpiece of recreational programming yourself? It's easy!

1.  **Make sure you have the Rust toolchain installed.** If not, visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/maidulislam-moon098/Tetris_rust.git](https://github.com/maidulislam-moon098/Tetris_rust.git)
    cd Tetris_rust
    ```

3.  **Run the game in release mode for max performance:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```
Enjoy the block-dropping mayhem!
